This project was built with the intention to further explore the usefulness of a framework (express) and continue familiarization with back-end routes built on node.js.

## Optimizations

When I improve this project, I'd like to move the data to a database. As this is a simple API, the data is currently stored in an array on the server itself.
## Lessons Learned:

I learned about Heroku cli and getting this app hosted in the cloud!
